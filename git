1.Diff between 

git fetch and git pull:

git fetch :If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, git fetch origin fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the git fetch command pulls the data to your local repository – it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re read.

git pull : Running git pull generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.
